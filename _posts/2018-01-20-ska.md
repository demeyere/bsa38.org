ska, kommer att, måste eller bör?
=================

It is interesting how much you can learn from the usage notes in the wiktionary&hellip;

> »<strong>kommer att</strong> may also be used to denote a future action, but while it denotes something inevitable (something absolutely certain); <strong>ska</strong> refers to something which is required, intended, or a promise. Compare also <strong>bör,</strong> which is a (very) strong recommendation, but not without possibility to wiggle out of; and <strong>måste</strong> which is used when there is a compelling need to do something.«

`en.wiktionary` är **alltid** en bra resurs! Ha det bra!
