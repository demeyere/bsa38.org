# About Troop 38

We meet at St Helena's in South Minneapolis.

> On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.

All of scouting is designed to promote physical, mental, and spiritual excellence. Troop 38 lives this. Every one of our scouts is somebody important. They hold themselves to these standards:

* Trustworthy
* Loyal
* Helpful
* Friendly
* Courteous
* Kind
* Obedient
* Cheerful
* Thrifty
* Brave  
* Clean  
* Reverent
