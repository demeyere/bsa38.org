# 45-hour campout standard

One of the troop's typical events is a weekend campout. This may be by ourselves or in conjunction with a district or council event like a camporee.

For a 45-hour campout we need to: 

* plan and bring all of our food and gear (unless otherwise informed).
* Eat dinner before you arrive Friday, as we do not plan a Friday evening meal.

In general, we will try to leave around 17:00 on Friday (eat dinner before you arrive) and 
return between mid-day Sunday. Since we can not accurately predict arrival times, 
scouts will call parents about 20 minutes before they are ready to be picked up. 
Please do not call us wondering where we are.

When we return on Sunday, we need to:

* Tents, if wet, need to be taken by one of the scouts that slept in it, 
  to be set up and dried at home and returned clean and dry and ready for the next campout. 
* Patrol boxes will be taken home by a scout designated by the Patrol Leader, 
  rewashed, repacked and returned at the following meeting.
